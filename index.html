                        </i> <br> <br><i>Xuantu</i> is a variant of the known work by the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci
                        and the scholar Li Zhizao李之藻 named Complete Map of the Myriad Kingdoms of the World.
                        It included geographical descriptions of the historical five continents, complete with
                        place-names, a précis of Ptolemaic cosmology, and paper instruments for measuring polar altitude
                        and latitude. <br>
                        <br> Xuantu matters because it prompts us to rethink the process of knowledge circulation
                        between China and early modern Europe. First, it is an example of a map translated outside the
                        realm of agency of either European or Chinese cartographies, despite its authors. The map was
                        present in the imperial palace at Shenyang at a key moment before the Manchus invaded China and
                        established the Qing, China's last imperial dynasty, and that the Manchus tried to make sense of
                        that moment through translation.
                        Secondly, the Xuantu illustrates a practice of cartographic translation that was also later used
                        in the West on Chinese maps.

                <div class="caption">
                    <p class="interactive" data-anim="zoom1">Indeed, Xuantu is important not so much for what it has in
                        it but for what it has on it: the repairs, modifications, and annotations added to the original
                        print.

                        <br> Material alterations, the content of annotations, and the form of the Manchu script are
                        three aspects that demonstrate the epistemological engagement of the Manchu translators of the
                        Later Jin state with the Map of Observing the Mysteries of the Heaven and Earth. The Xuantu is a
                        large object, measuring 2 meters (78.74 inches) vertically and 4.42
                        meters (174.01 inches) horizontally. As such, it fits awkwardly among Chinese prints from the
                        Ming dynasty. Maps of this size meant for a high-end audience of officials were rarely prints.
                        Instead, just as for paintings, Chinese artisans normally used silk, which was favored for its
                        superior durability. Silk, however, because of its cost, was more appropriate for the creation
                        of unique items. For Sino-Western world maps, the desire to quickly disseminate many copies
                        trumped that of creating solid, durable objects. World maps by Matteo Ricci and other Jesuits
                        thus came to occupy an important niche. They were as large in size as silk maps made for
                        important people, yet easily reproducible and affordable. This was at the root of their success
                        in the late Ming. It is also the reason why so few copies survived: large prints were fragile.

                <div class="caption">
                    <p class="interactive" data-anim="zoom2"> The Map of Observing Mysteries, like its 1602 predecessor,
                        the Map of Myriad Kingdoms, was intended by Ricci to be colored by hand, to better distinguish
                        the continents and land masses from the bodies of water. Since the coloring process had to be
                        done after the printing and involved the work of another specialized artisan, incurring
                        additional expenses, many copies remained black-and-white prints. The Shenyang copy, like the
                        Korean one, was originally uncolored. Yet during its life in the Shenyang palace, an artisan was
                        tasked with embellishing the mountain ranges across all the continents in the style of Chinese
                        painting. The color scheme of these decorations—blue, green, and gold—fits the one used
                        throughout the Shenyang palace.

                        Shenyang copy of the Map of Observing Mysteries displays a number of Manchu annotations.
                        These inscriptions consisted of both topology and technical elements. The technical
                        elements included the cosmological theory explained in the map's prefaces and surrounding texts.
                        The theory of the map expounded in the preface by Matteo Ricci presented relationships between
                        Earth's spherical shape, its position in the solar system, and the cycles of night and day.
                        All of these features, represented by lines on the map, had Manchu translations attached.

                        oceans, described in the preface by Ricci and other texts on the map, were also translated (fig
                        4.3). Taken together, they suggest that the Manchu translator had a grasp of and an interest in
                        the “theory” of the map, having read and understood the prefaces and other accompanying texts.

                        Manchu transcript on it. When it was used in the Shenyang palace, the Xuantu was damaged. Winters in Shenyang are
                        bitterly cold, and rooms must be heated. For this reason, there was a temperature difference
                        between the upper and lower parts of the room. This created condensation, and because the map
                        was most likely displayed vertically, the dampness damaged the portions closer to the ground.

                        repaired. An artisan had applied paper paste and, after it dried, redrew the meridians to give

                        Bukūri Yongšon. The addition of an in-scription alongside the mountain is an indication that
                        the place was meaningful for the Manchus as early as the Later Jin.

                        the Manchu written language was a direct invention of bilingual scholars working for Nurhaci and
                        was established in 1599. A well-known passage describes how Nurhaci noticed that Mongolian and
                        Chinese could be both written and spoken, while the Manchus needed to use Mongolian—a language
                        they did not speak as natives—to write documentsand proclamations. Consequently, Nurhaci asked
                        the polyglot scholar Erdeni and the judge Gagai to solve the problem and modify the Mongolian
                        script so as to write Manchu words. But because Mongolian letters could not perfectly represent
                        Manchu sounds, this version of the scripthad a few drawbacks. The script could not clearly
                        distinguish a and e,o and u, or k,g, and h. There was also no distinction between front and back
                        d and t, and there were uncertainties in spelling certain words.

                        aspect of this reform was the addition of dots and circles to solve the problem of distinction.
                        The addition of dots could separate a from e,o from u, and k from g, while circles would
                        distinguish k from h. This way of writing Manchu achieved virtually universal usage and has
                        remained the standard way of writing it to this day.
